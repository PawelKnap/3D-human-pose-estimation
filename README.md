# Real-time omnidirectional 3D multi-person human pose estimation with occlusion handling
Created by Pawel Knap based on previous project of Alberto Tamajo, Aarti Amin, Emil Stoev, Isaac Klugman and Timothy Fish (https://git.soton.ac.uk/at2n19/gdp).

# Introduction
The Center for Artificial Intelligence at the Korean Institute of Science & Technology (KIST) presented us with an ambitious task: to pioneer a prototype for a real-time multi-person 3D human pose estimation algorithm. This algorithm would utilize a 360° omni-directional camera and three mmWave radars, intended to be integrated into a humanoid robot operating in an indoor café at KIST. Despite the project's inherent complexity due to its novelty, we successfully introduced the algorithm that effectively estimates the 3D pose of individuals within the scene. The project's code and installation instructions are both included in this repository for reference.
