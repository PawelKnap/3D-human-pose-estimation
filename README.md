# Real-time omnidirectional 3D multi-person human pose estimation with occlusion handling
Created by Pawel Knap based on previous project of Alberto Tamajo, Aarti Amin, Emil Stoev, Isaac Klugman and Timothy Fish (https://git.soton.ac.uk/at2n19/gdp).

The updated version was created by Pawel Knap, Akira Lane, Georgy Markov, Joel Vong Wei Sheng, and Anthi Terezaki.

# Installation
To install and run the application, please follow the instructions in the User Guide.md file.

# Introduction
We present a real-time multi-person 3D human pose estimation algorithm. This algorithm utilizes a 360Â° omnidirectional camera and three mmWave radars. The project's code and installation instructions are both included in this repository for reference.
